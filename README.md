Hi there 👋

I'm a systems programming enthusiast with a deep passion for understanding how software really interacts with hardware. My focus is on performance, debugging, and exploring the internals of complex systems.

🧠 About Me

- ⚙️ My primary interest lies in OS development, embedded systems, and bare-metal programming.

- 🧩 I thrive on building custom tooling for systems programming and performance analysis.

- 💾 If it's close to the hardware, involves performance tuning, or requires deep debugging, I'm interested.
